If KYC process passed successfully AND soft cap reached, tokens will be distributed.

If we do not hit the soft cap, contributors have an unlimited time to refund their funds. 

In case we do not hit the soft cap, we have no possibility to withdraw the funds, due to this design of our smart contract we guarantee the contributor the maximum security that everyone is getting their funds back without enabling the ufoodo team to withdraw any funds.
